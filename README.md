Proper low-cost and low-power FOC supporting boards are very hard to find these days and even may not exist. Even harder to find is a stable and simple FOC algorithm code capable of running on Arduino devices. 
Therefore this is an attempt to: 
- Demistify FOC algorithm and make a robust but simple Arduino library: [Arduino SimpleFOC library](#arduino-simplefoclibrary)
- Develop a modular BLDCdriver boards: [Arduino SimpleFOC shield](https://askuric.github.io/Arduino-FOC/arduino_simplefoc_shield_showcase).

### Features
- **Plug & play**: Arduino <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>library</span> 
- **Low-cost**: Price in the range of \$20-\$40
- **Open Source**: Gerber files and BOM available
- **Stackable**: running 2 motors in the same time
