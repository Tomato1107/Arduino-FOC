## Magnetic sensor setup
In order to use your magnetic position sensor with Simple FOC library first create an instance of the `MagneticSensor` class:
```cpp
// MagneticSensor(int cs, float _cpr, int _angle_register)
//  cs              - SPI chip select pin 
//  _cpr            - counts per revolution 
// _angle_register  - (optional) angle read register - default 0x3FFF
MagneticSensor sensor = MagneticSensor(10, 16384, 0x3FFF);
```
The parameters of the class is the `chip select` pin number you connected your sensor to, the range of your sensor (counter value for full rotation) and your `angle register` number telling the library which register value should it ask the sensor for in order to retrieve the angle value. The default `angle_register` number is set to `0x3FFF` as it is the angle register for most of the low cost AS5x4x sensors. 

Finally after the inialisalisation the only thing you need to do afterwards is to call the `init()` function. This function prepares the SPI interface and initialises the sensor hardware. So your magnetic sensor intialisation code will look like:
```cpp
MagneticSensor sensor = MagneticSensor(10, 16384, 0x3FFF);

void loop(){
  ...
  sensor.init();
  ...
}
```

If you wish to use more than one magnetic sensor, make sure you connect their `chip select` pins to different arduino pins and follow the same idea as above, here is a simple example:
```cpp
MagneticSensor sensor1 = MagneticSensor(10, 16384, 0x3FFF);
MagneticSensor sensor1 = MagneticSensor(9, 16384, 0x3FFF);

void loop(){
  ...
  sensor1.init();
  sensor2.init();
  ...
}
```
