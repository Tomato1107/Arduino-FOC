### Voltage control loop
This control loop allows you to run the BLDC motor as it is simple DC motor using Park transformation. This mode is enabled by:
```cpp
// voltage control loop
motor.controller = ControlType::voltage;
```

You rcan test this algoithm by running the example `voltage_control.ino`.
The FOC algorithm reads the angle <i>a</i> from the motor and sets appropriate <i>u<sub>a</sub></i>, <i>u<sub>b</sub></i> and <i>u<sub>c</sub></i> voltages such to always have <i>90 degree</i> angle in between the magnetic fields of the permanent magents in rotor and the stator. What is exaclty the principle of the DC motor.
> This control loop will give you the motor which spins freely with the velocity depending on the voltage <i>U<sub>q</sub></i> you set and the disturbance it is facing. *It will turn slower if you try to hold it*.
