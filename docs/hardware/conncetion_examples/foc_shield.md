# Arduino <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>Shield</span> example
The <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>Shield</span>, being Arduino UNO shield, is compatible with any type of board with the same headers.
Essentially, it is a L6234 chip breakout board made in a form of Arduino Shield.

## Connector types
 - Terminal connectors 
    - motor phase lines `a`,`b` and `c`
    - power supply cables (12V to 24V)
 - Encoder connector
    - Integrated configurable pull-ups

More information on this link: [Arduino Simple FOC Shield](arduino_simplefoc_shield_showcase).

## Encoder 
- Channels `A` and `B` are connected to the encoder connector `P_ENC`, terminals `A` and `B`. 
- If your encoder has `index` signal you can connect it to the encoder connector as well, terminal `I`.

## Motor
- Motor phases `a`, `b` and `c` are connected directly the motor terminal connector `TB_M1`

<blockquote class="info"> <p class="heading">Alignment</p>
Motor phases <code>a</code>,<code>b</code>,<code>c</code> and encoder channels <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> have to have the same orientation for the algorithm to work. But don't worry about it too much. Connect it initially as you wish and then if the motor locks in place reverse phase <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> of the motor, that should be enough.
