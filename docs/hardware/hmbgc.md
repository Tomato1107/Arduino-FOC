## HMBGC V2.2
To use HMBGC controller for vector control (FOC) you need to connect motor to one of the motor terminals and connect the Encoder. The schema of connection is shown on the figures above, I also took a (very bad) picture of my setup.

### Encoder
Since HMBGC doesn't have access to the Arduino's external interrupt pins `2` and `3` and additionally we only have access to the analog pins, we need to read the encoder using the software interrupt. To show the functionality we provide one example of the HMBGC code (`HMBGC_example.ino`) using the [PciManager library](https://github.com/prampec/arduino-pcimanager).

- Encoder channels `A` and `B` are connected to the pins `A0` and `A1`.
- Optionally if your encoder has `index` signal you can connect it to any available pin, figure shows pin `A2`.  
### Motor
- Motor phases `a`,`b` and `c` are connected directly to the driver outputs
- Motor phases `a`,`b`,`c` and encoder channels `A` and `B` have to be oriented right for the algorithm to work. But don't worry about it too much. Connect it in initially as you wish and then if it doesn't move reverse phase `a` and `b` of the motor, that should be enough.

> HMBGC board doesn't support magnetic sensors because it doesn't have necessary SPI infrastructure.
