# Arduino <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span></span>library

This Arduino library implements Field Oriented Control algorihm for BLDC motors. FOC algorithm produces very shooth rotation patterns and very high deegree of torque, velocity and position control.
Additionally this library is intended both for beginners and advanced users:

## Features
- **Arduino compatibe**: Arduino library code version 
  - Arduino Library Manager integration
- **Open-Source**: Full code and documentation available on github
- **Easy to setup and configure**: 
  - Easy hardware configuration ([sensors](sensors), [BLDC motors](motor_initialization))
  - Easy [tuning the control loops](control_loops)
- **Modular**:
  - Supports as many [sensors ,  BLDC motors  and  driver boards](electrical_connections) as possible
  - Supports as many applicaiton requirements as possible
- **Plug & play**: Arduino SimpleFOC shield
