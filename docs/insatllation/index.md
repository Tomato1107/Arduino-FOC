# Installing the <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>library</span> 

There are two ways to install this Arduino library, depending of your plans with the code and your particular application.
- [Full library installation](library_download) - for plug & play functionality with many examples 
- [Minimal sketch installation](minimal_download) - Arduino sketch with integrated complete library
    - Easier experimentation and interaction with the library code directly
