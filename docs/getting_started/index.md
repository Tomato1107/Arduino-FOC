# Getting started with the <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>library</span> 

##  <i class="fa fa-desktop"></i>  Installation
There are two ways to install this Arduino library, depending of your plans with the code and your particular application.
- [Full library installation](library_download) - for plug & play functionality with many examples 
- [Minimal sketch installation](minimal_download) - Arduino sketch with integrated complete library
    - Easier experimentation and interaction with the library code directly

## <i class="fa fa-cubes"></i>  Supported hardware
Arduino <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>library</span> is made modular and will support most of the motor + sensor combinations out there, as well as many low-cost bldc driver boards.
Please see the [supported hardware documentation](supported_hardware) to learn more!

## <i class="fa fa-code"></i> Library Code
This library code is written in a way to be as simple sa possible to use and to leave a lot of space for configuration and fine tuning for specific applications. 
Please see the api [code documentation](code) to learn more in depth!

## <i class="fa fa-th-large"></i> Project Examples
We are very happy to provide you with several projects multiple hardware configurations and fully documented and explained code!
