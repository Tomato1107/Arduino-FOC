The components you need to have in order to run any Field Oriented Control algorithm as well as this library:

- [BLDC motor](bldc_motors)
- [BLDC driver](bldc_drivers)
- [Position sensor](position_sensors)
- [Microcontroller](microcontrollers) 


Arduino <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>library</span> is made modular and will support most of the motor + sensor combinations out there, as well as many low-cost bldc driver boards.

## Connection examples
For more information how to connect the BLDC motor, driver, microcontroller and the sensor please check the [connection examples](connection_examples) page.
