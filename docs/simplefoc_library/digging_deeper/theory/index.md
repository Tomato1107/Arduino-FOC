# Theory lovers corner

Hey guys, this is the section Iam going to explain some interesting theoretical features of the Arduino <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>library</span> implementation. For now, I have briefly written only about few topics, but I plan to make this properly very soon:

- [Torque control using voltage](voltage_torque_control)
- [Low pass filter theory](low_pass_filter)
- [PI controller theory](pi_controller)
- [FOC algorithm](foc_theory)
