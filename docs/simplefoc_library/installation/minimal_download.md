# <span class="simple">Simple<span class="foc">FOC</span>library</span> minimal code

For those willing to experiment and to modify the code I suggest using the [<i class="fa fa-code-fork"></i> minimal](https://github.com/askuric/Arduino-FOC/tree/minimal) code version. 
<blockquote class="info"><p class="heading">Note</p>This code is completely independent and you can run it as any other Arduino Sketch without the need for any libraries.</blockquote> 

## <i class="fa fa-github"></i>  Installation
This version of the code you can access directly using github interface.
### <i class="fa fa-download"></i> ZIP download 
- Go to [<i class="fa fa-code-fork"></i> minimal](https://github.com/askuric/Arduino-FOC/tree/minimal) branch. 
- Download the code by clicking on the `Clone or Download > Download ZIP`.
- Unzip it and open the sketch in Arduino IDE. 

### <i class="fa fa-terminal"></i> Clone using terminal 
- Open the terminal:
  ```sh
  cd *to you desired directory*
  git clone -b minimal https://github.com/askuric/Arduino-FOC.git
  ```
- Open it with the Arduino IDE and run it.

## <i class="fa fa-desktop"></i> Minimal code in Arduino IDE
Once when you have opened the code in the Arduino IDE you will be able to see the full library code in your IDE tabs. And you will be able to change code, adapt the classes to your specific hardware, add additional functionalities and similar.  Here is how it will look in Arduino IDE.
